                Marguerite's childhood was spent on the move. From Birmingham to
                Cardiff to Essex, to Norfolk [two separate places], followed by
                London. She is now settled in Bristol. She sees herself as a
                city person who also loves the tranquillity of the English
                countryside, the wild energy of the Atlantic, the
                unpredictability of the Lake district and the moodiness of the
                hills and mountains of Scotland. She says my background gave me
                an opportunity to recognise how different we all are, but
                paradoxically how alike we are. Her writing expresses an
                appreciation of place and a need to understand why people behave
                in certain ways.
              </p>
              <p>
                When she's not writing, she's thinking about interior design,
                describing her style as bohemian chic, reading poetry, modern
                and not so modern, listening to the wonderful and talented jazz
                musicians who live and work in Bristol, watching psychological
                films, and late night surreal 'stand up' comedians.

                Narrative nonfiction uses the style of fiction to communicate in
                an accessible way issues usually found in nonfiction. So for
                example, In
                <i>Talk Therapy: A Radical History for Troubled Times</i>, the
                author considers the interrelationship between an individual and
                society. She writes 'Psychotherapy is like a piece of improvised
                music. It has no preconceived stopping or starting point and at
                its best, its potential is profoundly creative and therapeutic.'
              </p>
              <p>
                The Arbours Association is a radical psychotherapy organisation
                which was established in London in the early seventies. The book
                describes the training of an Arbours therapist. Milieu therapy
                is compared with the traditional analytic perspective of one-
                to- one. Finally, the author points to the psychic usefulness of
                certain iconic films, some of which contribute to a deeper
                understanding of social and personal problems.

              <h3>My Name is Echo</h3>
              <p>
                <i>My Name is Echo</i> is told in the style of magical phantasy.
                Set in Wales and London, it's the story of a feisty young woman
                with a problematic relationship with her mother. An absent
                father leaves her open to a wild infatuation with a Welsh poet.
                But life is never simple, and Echo finds her own unique way of
                challenging and facing up to life's problems.

                A series of original papers which consider some of the
                complexities of being a psychotherapist. Intended for
                therapists, counsellors, mental health workers and anyone
                interested in the therapeutic process and perspective, a number
                of topics are considered. These range through ethical,
                political, theoretical issues but also point to the use of
                certain films as a way of making sense of complex behaviour.
